# This project is developed using C++
In this project I implemented Different Board Styles:  
1.3x3 BOARD  
2.4x4 BOARD  
3.5x5 BOARD  
The users can also save their progress in the middle of the game with their details, date, timings and moves being counted.  
So that the next time they can load their progress as well from where they left off.  
It is a 2 vs 2 local players Game.
